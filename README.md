## General Information
Lending club case study is analysis of various factors on loan repayment. The insights of this analysis will help banks to identify if a person is likely to replay loan or not.<br /><br />
The idea behind implementing this project is to underatand how real business problems are solved using EDA. Apart from applying EDA techniques, we also learnt about risk analytics in banking and financial services.<br /><br />
Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
Loan data set contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011.

## Conclusions
<li>Majority of loans fall within the range of <strong>6000 to 18000</strong>.</li>
<li>Significant portion of defaulters opted for a <strong>36 months</strong> loan term.</li>
<li>Majority of individuals who defaulted on their loans had taken loans with interest rates ranging from <strong>10-15%</strong>.</li>
<li>Majority of individuals who default on payments have an annual income ranging from <strong>40000 to 70000</strong>.</li>
<li>Majority of individuals who have defaulted on their payments reside in <strong>rented</strong> accommodations.</li>
<li>Majority of individuals who defaulted on their loans used the funds for <strong>debt consolidation</strong> while the fewest number of people used the money for <strong>renewable energy</strong> purposes.</li>
<li>Majority of loans were allocated for <strong>Small Business</strong> purposes, while the lowest loan amounts were provided for <strong>Moving</strong> purposes.</li>
<li><strong>loan_amnt</strong>, <strong>int_rate</strong> and <strong>annual_inc</strong> are related together ie have <strong>positive correlation</strong>.</li>
<li>Increasing debt to income ratio the default rate also increases upto range <strong>10-15</strong> but drops after that and most drop range is at <strong>25-30</strong>. This drop might be explained with a reason that people with very high debt to income ratio dont want to increase their debt further so they mostly pay off thier loans.</li>
<li>Majority of individuals who defaulted on their payments belong to job <strong>grade B</strong>.</li>
<li>Majority of defaulters are residents of the state <strong>CA</strong>.</li>
<li>Majority of defaulted loans were approved in the state of <strong>CA</strong>.</li>
<li>Majority of individuals who defaulted on their payments had  <strong>10+ years</strong> of work experience.</li>
